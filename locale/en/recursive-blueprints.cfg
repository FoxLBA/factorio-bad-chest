[item-description]
blueprint-deployer=[font=default-bold][color=yellow]Warning:[/color] This device is deprecated! It has not been completely removed from the mod only for compatibility with old blueprints.[/font]\nAutomatically builds an inserted blueprint.
blueprint-deployer2=(Blueprint Automated Deployment) Automatically builds an inserted blueprint.
recursive-blueprints-scanner=Counts the number of objects in the area.
rbp-tool=Calculates the size of the selected area and the offset relative to the selected object.\nLMB - select an area.\nShift+LMB - select an object as a reference point.\nRMB - write last data to constant combinator.

recursive-blueprints-area=Area X,Y position

recursive-blueprints-deployer-deploy-signal=Deploy signal for the deployer
recursive-blueprints-tool-area=Offset tool: Area X,Y position
recursive-blueprints-tool-coordinates=Offset tool: Reference point

[mod-setting-description]
recursive-blueprints-area=By default, interpret the received coordinates (X and Y signals) as the "Corner" or "Center" of the area (for scanner, deconstruction plan and upgrade plan).
recursive-blueprints-logging=Condition for displaying debug messages.
recursive-blueprints-deployer-deploy-signal=When "Both" is selected, the signal "0" is in priority.\nUse the signal "0" (zero) instead of the construction robot signal for consistency with nested navigation. And also to avoid the use of item-signals to control the deployer.
recursive-blueprints-tool-area=Which point of the area should be calculated?
recursive-blueprints-tool-coordinates=What coordinates should be used?\nFor relative coordinates, it is necessary to select a building as a reference point (Use Shift+LMB to select one).
