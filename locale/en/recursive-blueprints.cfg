recursive-blueprints-scanner=Counts the number of objects in the area.
rbp-tool=Calculates the size of the selected area and the offset relative to the selected object.\nLMB - select an area.\nShift+LMB - select an object as a reference point.\nRMB - write last data to constant combinator.

[mod-setting-description]
recursive-blueprints-area=Position of the X and Y signals in the deconstruction or upgrade area.
recursive-blueprints-logging=Condition for displaying debug messages.
recursive-blueprints-deployer-deploy-signal=When "Both" is selected, the signal "0" is in priority.\nUse the signal "0" (zero) instead of the construction robot signal for consistency with nested navigation. And also to avoid the use of item-signals to control the deployer.
